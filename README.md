# Simmerplate

A "good enough" UI baseline so you can focus on development. It's not quite a boilerplate.

## About the Project

Browser defaults for text and most HTML elements are awful. CSS normalizers improve things but still look too "default." CSS frameworks come with a ton of baggage you often don't need.

Simmerplate is a single drop-in CSS file to get initial formatting out of the way.

### Simmerplate Is

Simmerplate is an _approximation_ of designed typography and UI polish. It aims to be a quick-and-easy, better-than-default theme for prototyping or quick development projects.

Aside for providing sane spacing and layout tweaks to make your project look good'ish, you'll get:

* Solid-looking typography with good vertical rhythm
* Better-than-default styling for form elements
* A sound starting point for creating your own typography styles; it's non-specific and easy to override
* A no-worries, "fine for now" development baseline so you can focus on heavy-lifting, not finessing text, forms, and other HTML elements


### Simmerplate is Not

Simmerplate is not trying to be a robust visual system. It is not a full theme or CSS framework. It doesn't include a grid. It contains no Javascript and relies on what browsers are able to process purely via CSS. Simmerplate merely tries to whip the browser default UI into better shape.

Simmerplate is not precious: it expects you to style over it or scrap it for something better when visuals start to matter.
